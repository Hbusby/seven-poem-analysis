    "description": "“Seven” by Taylor Swift is a poem that was first released in 2022. It deals with the recurring theme of loss of innocence and reimagines the reader as a younger version of themselves and how youth is remembered. The poem was initially written in prose and debuted as a recorded interlude/transition between the Red and Folklore segments in Swift's wildly successful Era’s Tour. This project is an analysis of the poems' audio qualities.",
